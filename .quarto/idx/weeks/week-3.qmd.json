Columns are *variable* names and rows are individual *observations*. Just like other data structures dicussed in previous chapters, a DataFrame handles different data types:\n- int64: whole numbers (e.g age = 30)\n\n- float64; numbers with decimals (e.g. height = 1.9, temperature = 33.0)\n\n- datetime64: date and time\n\n- category: catogories or factors (e.g. gender = male, female; race = black, white, ...)\n\n- bool: True or False\n\n- object: string \n\n\nAccording to Hadley Wickman, a DataFrame should be in a *tidy* format:\n\n> 1.  Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.\n> 2.  Each observation is row; each row is an observation.\n> 3.  Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value. \n\n\nThe pandas package provide a toolbox of working analysing, querying and transforming DataFrames. We will continue working with the `gapminder dataset. First load pandas and read the data, saving it as \"gapminder\":\n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\n\ngapminder = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aubreympungose/data-science-course/main/weeks/data/gapminder.csv\")\n```\n\n\nLet's examine the data by looking at few observations:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.head()\n```\n\nYou can check how many variables are in the data and what type of data:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.info()\n```\n\nYou can see that `gapminder` has 6 columns and 1704 rows. The columns in the dataset are:\n\n- country: Simply the country\n\n- continent: Continent\n\n- year: The year data was collected\n\n- lifeExp: Life expectancy of a country in year\n\n- pop: Population of the country in a year\n\n- gdpPercap: Gross Domestic Product of a country in a year\n\n\nYou can also print the columns in the dataset by using `.columns` attribute. \n\n```{python}\ngapminder.columns\n```\nYou can get the number of rows by using `.index` attribute:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.index\n```\n\n\n## MANIPULATING COLUMNS\n\n#### Access/Select columns\n\nWe may be interested in some of the columns in the `gampminder` dataframe, let say, for example, \"country\" only. You can select a specific column by taking  the name of the DataFrame, followed by square brackets (`[]`) and passing the name of the \"column\" inside square brackets:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder[\"country\"]\n```\n\nTo Access multiple, columns you follow the same method as above, except that you wrap column names list (`[]`), so you end up with double sqaure brackets. Let's say we want to select \"country\", \"pop\", and \"year\" columns:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder[[\"country\", \"pop\", \"year\"]]\n```\n\n\nYou can alse access columns by their index using `.iloc()` function. Remember that an index in Python starts at 0, for example, to access the first column\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.iloc[:, 0]\n```\n\nIn the above code, the colon (`:`) specify that we want to retun all rows; you will more abouth this when selecting by both columns and rows.\n\nTo access multiple columns, you pass a list of indexes of columns. For example, select the 1st, 3rd and 5th columns:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.iloc[:, [0, 2, 4]]\n```\n\nSuppose you want access a range of of columns, for example, from the 1st to the 3rd column:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.iloc[:, 0:3]\n```\n\n### Rename columns\n\nYou may need to change column names. For example, in the `gapminder` dataset, we may change the \"pop\" column to population. You will use the `.rename()` function, pass the column argument, and specify column names within the dictionary (`{\"old_name\":\"new_name\"}`). We will assign the results to the new DataFrame named `gapminder_new`:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder_new = gapminder.rename(columns = {\"pop\":\"population\"})\n\ngapminder_new.head()\n```\n\nThe \"pop\" column has been changed to \"population\".\n\nYou can also rename multiple columns; in this case, rename \"lifeExp\" and \"gdpPercap\":\n\n```{python}\ngapminder_new = gapminder.rename(columns = {\"lifeExp\":\"life_expectancy\", \"gdpPercap\":\"gdp_pc\"})\n\ngapminder_new.head()\n```\n\n### Making new columns, Removing columns\n\nTo create a new column you simply take the name of the dataframe, pass the string of the new columnn inside sqaure bracket, and assign values:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder[\"new_column\"] = 20\n\ngapminder.head()\n```\nThere is a new column added that has values of 20. \n\nIn many cases, we may need to create a new column resulting from manipulating other columns. For example, we know that the GDP per capita is calculated from dividing the total GDP by a population. If we want to create a new column of the total GDP, we need to multiply GDP per capita by the population size of the country:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder[\"total_gdp\"] = gapminder[\"gdpPercap\"] * gapminder[\"pop\"]\n\ngapminder.head()\n```\n\nWe have a new column (\"total_gdp\") added to the `gapminder` DataFrame. \n\nYou can remove columns by using `.drop() function:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder = gapminder.drop([\"total_gdp\", \"new_column\"], axis = 1)\n\ngapminder.head()\n```\n\n### Sort columns\n\nYou can values b any column by using `.sort_values()` function:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.sort_values([\"lifeExp\"])\n```\n\nYou can see that Rwanda had the lowest life expectancy. \n\nTo sort values into descending order (highest to lowest), you pass `ascending = False`:\n\n```{python}\ngapminder.sort_values([\"pop\"], ascending = False)\n```\n\nYou can see that China had the highest population.\n\n## Manipulate Rows","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n# 4.1 PART I\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n-   Understand DataFrames\n\n-   Manipulate, transform and analyse DataFrames\n\n## 4.1.1 Introduction\n\nDataframes, as we saw [the previous section](week-2.qmd), is a tabular data format, with columns and rows.
