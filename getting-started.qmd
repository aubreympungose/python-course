## 1.1 Installing Python

For beginners, I recommend that you set up Python in  Anacoda. You will also use VScode IDE for interacting with Python. An IDE makes it easier to code interactively. To set up everything (Anaconda, Python and VSCode) that will be required for this course, please visit [this resource](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/introduction.html) and got to "Prerequisites" section.


After installing everything, you should be able to start coding.
